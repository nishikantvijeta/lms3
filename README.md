# LMS - Learning Management System

This is a **Learning Management System (LMS)** Dashboard project built using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). It allows students and instructors to manage courses, view content, track progress, and more — all from a clean and responsive web interface.

Both the **frontend** and **backend** servers are started using:

```bash
npm run start
```
